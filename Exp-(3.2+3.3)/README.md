# 🚀 Single Page Application (SPA) Routing Portfolio

This project documents the architectural evolution of a React-based Single Page Application, progressing from standard text-based link navigation to an advanced, interactive button-driven interface.

## 🧪 Experiment 2: Navigation Using Link Component

### **Aim**
To implement responsive navigation links in a Single Page Application using the React Router `Link` component.

### **Technical Overview**
In this experiment, the foundational routing architecture was established. The focus was on enabling seamless state transitions between the **Profile** and **Dashboard** views without triggering browser reloads.

* **Semantic Routing**: Mapped `/profile` and `/dashboard` to specific functional components.
* **SPA Methodology**: Utilized the `<Link>` component from `react-router-dom` to intercept browser requests and update the UI via the HTML5 History API.
* **UI/UX Design**: Developed a centered, high-contrast dashboard layout with neon cyan accents.

## 🧪 Experiment 3: Multi-Page SPA Using Routing

### **Aim**
To architect a multi-page SPA utilizing interactive button-driven navigation and "YouTube-style" brand redirection logic.

### **Professional Aspirations**
I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer dedicated to architecting high-performance web solutions that bridge the gap between complex engineering principles and intuitive user experiences. My core interests lie in system architecture, performance optimization, and the "Liquid Glass" design aesthetic. I am constantly exploring modern frontend frameworks like React and Vite to build precision-engineered platforms that empower users through visual clarity and technical accuracy.
